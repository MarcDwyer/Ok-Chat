Ok-Chat a desktop app that allows the user to join multiple streamer's live chat at the same time.
This app is currently under very early developement, but expect to see the same funcionaility that Twitch's own chat has and much more, such as; color coded messages (is a mod, direct message and your own messages), bttv emotes, paused chat functionality, and more fun stuff that I haven't thought about yet. Fully intend to add compatibility for 3rd party emotes such as BTTV.
